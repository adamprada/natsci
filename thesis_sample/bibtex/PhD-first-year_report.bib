abstract = {Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) thermostats have been used very effectively as a tool to manipulate and optimize the sampling of thermodynamic ensembles and the associated static properties. Here we show that a similar, exquisite level of control can be achieved for the dynamical properties computed from thermostatted trajectories. By developing quantitative measures of the disturbance induced by the GLE to the Hamiltonian dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we show that these analytical results accurately predict the behavior of strongly anharmonic systems. We also show that it is possible to correct, to a significant extent, the effects of the GLE term onto the corresponding microcanonical dynamics, which puts on more solid grounds the use of non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics to approximate quantum nuclear effects and could help improve the prediction of dynamical quantities from techniques that use a Langevin term to stabilize dynamics. Finally we address the use of thermostats in the context of approximate path-integral-based models of quantum nuclear dynamics. We demonstrate that a custom-tailored GLE can alleviate some of the artifacts associated with these techniques, improving the quality of results for the modelling of vibrational dynamics of molecules, liquids and solids.},

@article{Ishizaki2008,
abstract = {Based on the influence functional formalism, we have derived a nonperturbative equation of motion for a reduced system coupled to a harmonic bath with colored noise in which the system-bath coupling operator does not necessarily commute with the system Hamiltonian. The resultant expression coincides with the time-convolutionless quantum master equation derived from the second-order perturbative approximation, which is also equivalent to a generalized Redfield equation. This agreement occurs because, in the nonperturbative case, the relaxation operators arise from the higher-order system-bath interaction that can be incorporated into the reduced density matrix as the influence operator; while the second-order interaction remains as a relaxation operator in the equation of motion. While the equation describes the exact dynamics of the density matrix beyond weak system-bath interactions, it does not have the capability to calculate nonlinear response functions appropriately. This is because the equation cannot describe memory effects which straddle the external system interactions due to the reduced description of the bath. To illustrate this point, we have calculated the third-order two-dimensional (2D) spectra for a two-level system from the present approach and the hierarchically coupled equations approach that can handle quantal system-bath coherence thanks to its hierarchical formalism. The numerical demonstration clearly indicates the lack of the system-bath correlation in the present formalism as fast dephasing profiles of the 2D spectra. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) is a popular method to extract approximate quantum dynamics from path integral simulations. Very recently we have shown that CMD gas phase infrared spectra exhibit significant artificial redshifts of stretching peaks, due to the so-called "curvature problem" imprinted by the effective centroid potential. Here we provide evidence that for condensed phases, and in particular for liquid water, CMD produces pronounced artificial redshifts for high-frequency vibrations such as the OH stretching band. This peculiar behavior intrinsic to the CMD method explains part of the unexpectedly large quantum redshifts of the stretching band of liquid water compared to classical frequencies, which is improved after applying a simple and rough "harmonic curvature correction."},

The significance$\backslash$nof quantum effects on the properties of water, however, has not yet$\backslash$nbeen fully resolved. In this paper we focus on quantum dynamical$\backslash$neffects in liquid water based on the linearized semiclassical initial$\backslash$nvalue representation (LSC-IVR) with a quantum version of the simple$\backslash$npoint charge/flexible (q-SPC/fw) model [Paesani et al., J.

abstract = {Because of the low mass of the proton, nuclear quantum effects can dramatically alter the properties of hydrogen-bond networks, especially when short and strong hydrogen bonds occur. Here, we combine experiments and state-of-the-art simulations that include the quantum nature of both the electrons and nuclei to show that the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase contains a hydrogen-bond network in its active site that facilitates extensive quantum proton delocalization. This leads to a 10,000-fold increase in the acidity of an active-site residue compared with the limit where the nuclei are classical particles. This work opens up new avenues for understanding the interplay between quantum effects and hydrogen bonding in biological systems containing strong hydrogen bonds.Enzymes use protein architectures to create highly specialized structural motifs that can greatly enhance the rates of complex chemical transformations. Here, we use experiments, combined with ab initio simulations that exactly include nuclear quantum effects, to show that a triad of strongly hydrogen-bonded tyrosine residues within the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) facilitates quantum proton delocalization. This delocalization dramatically stabilizes the deprotonation of an active-site tyrosine residue, resulting in a very large isotope effect on its acidity. When an intermediate analog is docked, it is incorporated into the hydrogen-bond network, giving rise to extended quantum proton delocalization in the active site. These results shed light on the role of nuclear quantum effects in the hydrogen-bond network that stabilizes the reactive intermediate of KSI, and the behavior of protons in biological systems containing strong hydrogen bonds.},

abstract = {Excitonic models of light-harvesting complexes, where the vibrational degrees of freedom are treated as a bath, are commonly used to describe the motion of the electronic excitation through a molecule. Recent experiments point toward the possibility of memory effects in this process and require one to consider time nonlocal propagation techniques. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) were proposed by Ishizaki and Fleming to describe the site-dependent reorganization dynamics of protein environments ( J. Chem. Phys. 2009 , 130 , 234111 ), which plays a significant role in photosynthetic electronic energy transfer. HEOM are often used as a reference for other approximate methods but have been implemented only for small systems due to their adverse computational scaling with the system size. Here, we show that HEOM are also solvable for larger systems, since the underlying algorithm is ideally suited for the usage of graphics processing units (GPU). The tremendous reduction in computational time due to the GPU allows us to perform a systematic study of the energy-transfer efficiency in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) light-harvesting complex at physiological temperature under full consideration of memory effects. We find that approximative methods differ qualitatively and quantitatively from the HEOM results and discuss the importance of finite temperature to achieving high energy-transfer efficiencies.},

As shown, both classes of dynamics are able to recover the exact classical and high temperature limits of the quantum time correlation function, while a subset is able to recover the exact harmonic limit. A comparison of the approximate quantum time correlation functions obtained from both classes of dynamics is made with the exact results for the challenging model problems of the quartic and double-well potentials. It is found that these dynamics provide a great improvement over the classical Wigner approximation, in which purely classical dynamics are used. In a special case, our first method becomes identical to centroid molecular dynamics.},

abstract = {For a system strongly coupled to a heat bath, the quantum coherence of the system and the heat bath plays an important role in the system dynamics. This is particularly true in the case of non- Markovian noise. We rigorously investigate the influence of system-bath coherence by deriving the reduced hierarchal equations of motion (HEOM), not only in real time, but also in imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature. It is shown that the HEOM in real time obtained when we include the system-bath coherence of the initial thermal equilibrium state possess the same form as those obtained from a factorized initial state.We find that the difference in behavior of systems treated in these two manners results from the difference in initial conditions of the HEOM elements, which are defined in path integral form. We also derive HEOM along the imaginary time path to obtain the thermal equilibrium state of a system strongly coupled to a non-Markovian bath. Then, we show that the steady state hierarchy elements calculated from the real-time HEOM can be expressed in terms of the hierarchy elements calculated from the imaginary-time HEOM. Moreover, we find that the imaginary-time HEOM allow us to evaluate a number of thermodynamic variables, including the free energy, entropy, internal energy, heat capacity, and susceptibility. The expectation values of the system energy and system-bath interaction energy in the thermal equilibrium state are also evaluated.},

abstract = {The path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method provides a convenient way to compute the quantum mechanical structural and thermodynamic properties of condensed phase systems at the expense of introducing an additional set of high frequency normal modes on top of the physical vibrations of the system. Efficiently sampling such a wide range of frequencies provides a considerable thermostatting challenge. Here we introduce a simple stochastic path integral Langevin equation (PILE) thermostat which exploits an analytic knowledge of the free path integral normal mode frequencies. We also apply a recently developed colored noise thermostat based on a generalized Langevin equation (GLE), which automatically achieves a similar, frequency-optimized sampling. The sampling efficiencies of these thermostats are compared with that of the more conventional Nos{\'{e}}–Hoover chain (NHC) thermostat for a number of physically relevant properties of the liquid water and hydrogen-in-palladium systems. In nearly every case, the new PILE thermostat is found to perform just as well as the NHC thermostat while allowing for a computationally more efficient implementation. The GLE thermostat also proves to be very robust delivering a near-optimum sampling efficiency in all of the cases considered. We suspect that these simple stochastic thermostats will therefore find useful application in many future PIMD simulations.},

Although protein motions are frequently observed during ligand binding and release steps, the contribution of protein motions to the catalysis of bond making/breaking processes is more difficult to probe and verify. Here, we show how the quantum mechanical hydrogen tunneling associated with enzymatic C-H bond cleavage provides a unique window into the necessity of protein dynamics for achieving optimal catalysis. Experimental findings support a hierarchy of thermodynamically equilibrated motions that control the H-donor and -acceptor distance and active-site electrostatics, creating an ensemble of conformations suitable for H-tunneling. A possible extension of this view to methyl transfer and other catalyzed reactions is also presented. The impact of understanding these dynamics on the conceptual framework for enzyme activity, inhibitor/drug design, and biomimetic catalyst design is likely to be substantial.},

The calculations are performed using the quasiadiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI) methodology to evaluate the flux–flux correlation function whose time integral determines the rate coefficient. The discretized path integral converges very rapidly in the QUAPI representation, allowing efficient calculation of quantum correlation functions for sufficiently long times. No ad hoc assumption is introduced and thus these calculations yield the true quantum mechanical rate constants. The results presented in the paper demonstrate the applicability of the QUAPI methodology to practically all regimes of chemical interest, from thermal activation to deep tunneling, and the quantum transmission factor exhibits a Kramers turnover. Our calculations reveal an unusual step structure of the integrated reactive flux in the weak friction regime as well as quantum dynamical enhancement of the rate above the quantum transition state theory value at low temperatures, which is largely due to vibrational coherenceeffects. The quantum rates are compared to those obtained from classical trajectory simulations. We also use the numerically exact classical and quantum results to establish the degree of accuracy of several analytic and numerical approximations, including classical and quantum Grote–Hynes theories, semiclassical transition state theory (periodic orbit) estimates, classical and quantum turnover theories, and the centroid density approximation.},

First is the popular mixed quantum-classical approach that has been widely used by many persons, and second is an approximate version of the semiclassical initial value representation that has recently undergone a rebirth of interest as a way for including quantum effects in molecular dynamics simulations.

abstract = {Numerous studies have identified large quantum mechanical effects in the dynamics of liquid water. In this paper, we suggest that these effects may have been overestimated due to the use of rigid water models and flexible models in which the intramolecular interactions were described using simple harmonic functions. To demonstrate this, we introduce a new simple point charge model for liquid water, q-TIP4P/F, in which the O-H stretches are described by Morse-type functions. We have parametrized this model to give the correct liquid structure, diffusion coefficient, and infrared absorption frequencies in quantum (path integral-based) simulations. The model also reproduces the experimental temperature variation of the liquid density and affords reasonable agreement with the experimental melting temperature of hexagonal ice at atmospheric pressure. By comparing classical and quantum simulations of the liquid, we find that quantum mechanical fluctuations increase the rates of translational diffusion and orientational relaxation in our model by a factor of around 1.15. This effect is much smaller than that observed in all previous simulations of empirical water models, which have found a quantum effect of at least 1.4 regardless of the quantum simulation method or the water model employed. The small quantum effect in our model is a result of two competing phenomena. Intermolecular zero point energy and tunneling effects destabilize the hydrogen-bonding network, leading to a less viscous liquid with a larger diffusion coefficient. However, this is offset by intramolecular zero point motion, which changes the average water monomer geometry resulting in a larger dipole moment, stronger intermolecular interactions, and a slower diffusion. We end by suggesting, on the basis of simulations of other potential energy models, that the small quantum effect we find in the diffusion coefficient is associated with the ability of our model to produce a single broad O-H stretching band in the infrared absorption spectrum.},

@article{Chandler1981,
abstract = {From a discretization of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, it is possible to relate equilibrium quantum many body theory to classical statistical mechanics. In this paper, we significantly extend and analyze this well known isomorphism in terms of the equilibrium theory of classical molecular fluids composed of flexible polyatomic species. We show how quantum influence functionals are isomorphic to classical cavity distribution functions. The former describe the influence of surrounding media on the dynamics of quantal degrees of freedom, and the latter describe environmental effects for classical models of flexible molecules and chemical equilibria. The connection allows the use of classical theories to perform nonperturbative calculations of influence functionals which treat the influence functionals and many body correlation functions in a self‐consistent fashion. We illustrate the computational advantages of the method by studying its predictions for a hard sphere model of liquid helium above the l transition. The nature of quantum indistinguishability of identical particles (i.e., quantum exchange) is treated in our theory in terms of an exact isomorphism with chemical equilibria. This connection allows the treatment of exchange in condensed phases in terms of the classical law of mass action, and provides a computational advance over existing methods for interacting systems. By picturing exchange in terms of classical association equilibrium, we arrive at a view (hinted at long ago by Feynman and by Penrose and Onsager) in which the Bose condensation is related to an equilibrium polymeric sol–gel transition. Thus, below the l transition, the correlations in liquid helium are equivalent to those in a classical fluid containing a finite concentration of macroscopic polymers. We stress how the path integral aspect of the isomorphism leads to useful geometrical interpretations of quantum phenomena. For example, tunneling phenomena can be viewed in terms of solitonic (or instantonic) configurations or flexible chain molecules. With this picture, we show how the isomorphism can be employed to understand both adiabatic and nonadiabatic solvent effects on chemical bonding. For concreteness, we provide a detailed analysis of a particular model of the chemical bond for which a partial summation over intermediate quantum paths leads to an Ising model problem in the isomorphism. While applications like this are presented in the form of qualitative illustrations, a variety of methods can be employed to produce quantitative results. We sketch how these calculations can be performed for various problems, making connections with methods like the renormalization group (RG) technique. The classical isomorphism together with the modern theory of classical polyatomic systems provides a powerful framework for quantitative solutions of condensed matter quantum mechanical problems.},

The corresponding continued-fraction Green's functions formalism for quantum dissipation is also presented. Proposed further is the principle of residue correction, not just for truncating the infinite hierarchy, but also for incorporating the small residue dissipation that may arise from the practical difference between the true and parametrized bath correlation functions.

However, the overwhelming majority of such simulations still assume that the nuclei behave as classical particles. While historically this approximation could sometimes be justified due to complexity and computational overhead, the lack of nuclear quantum effects has become one of the biggest sources of error when systems containing light atoms are treated using current state-of-the-art descriptions of chemical interactions. Over the past decade, this realization has spurred a series of methodological advances that have led to dramatic reductions in the cost of including these important physical effects in the structure and dynamics of chemical systems. Here we show how these developments are now allowing nuclear quantum effects to become a mainstream feature of molecular simulations. These advances have led to new insights into chemical processes in the condensed phase and open the door to many exciting future opportunities.},

abstract = {Starting from a system-bath Hamiltonian in a molecular coordinate representation, we examine an applicability of a stochastic multilevel model for vibrational dephasing and energy relaxation in multidimensional infrared spectroscopy. We consider an intramolecular anharmonic mode nonlinearly coupled to a colored noise bath at finite temperature. The system-bath interaction is assumed linear plus square in the system coordinate, but linear in the bath coordinates. The square-linear system-bath interaction leads to dephasing due to the frequency fluctuation of system vibration, while the linear-linear interaction contributes to energy relaxation and a part of dephasing arises from anharmonicity. To clarify the role and origin of vibrational dephasing and energy relaxation in the stochastic model, the system part is then transformed into an energy eigenstate representation without using the rotating wave approximation. Two-dimensional (2D) infrared spectra are then calculated by solving a low-temperature corrected quantum Fokker-Planck (LTC-QFP) equation for a colored noise bath and by the stochastic theory. In motional narrowing regime, the spectra from the stochastic model are quite different from those from the LTC-QFP. In spectral diffusion regime, however, the 2D line shapes from the stochastic model resemble those from the LTC-QFP besides the blueshifts caused by the dissipation from the colored noise bath. The preconditions for validity of the stochastic theory for molecular vibrational motion are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Matsubara dynamics is the quantum-Boltzmann-conserving classical dynamics which remains when real-time coherences are taken out of the exact quantum Liouvillian [T. J. H. Hele et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 134103 (2015)]; because of a phase-term, it cannot be used as a practical method without further approximation. Recently, Smith et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 142, 244112 (2015)] developed a "planetary" model dynamics which conserves the Feynman-Kleinert (FK) approximation to the quantum-Boltzmann distribution. Here, we show that for moderately anharmonic potentials, the planetary dynamics gives a good approximation to Matsubara trajectories on the FK potential surface by decoupling the centroid trajectory from the locally harmonic Matsubara fluctuations, which reduce to a single phase-less fluctuation particle (the "planet"). We also show that the FK effective frequency can be approximated by a direct integral over these fluctuations, obviating the need to solve iterative equations. This modification, together with use of thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics, allows us to test the planetary model on water (gas-phase, liquid, and ice) using the q-TIP4P/F potential surface. The "planetary" fluctuations give a poor approximation to the rotational/librational bands in the infrared spectrum, but a good approximation to the bend and stretch bands, where the fluctuation lineshape is found to be motionally narrowed by the vibrations of the centroid. },

@article{Tanimura2009a,
abstract = {Spectral line shapes in a condensed phase contain information from various dynamic processes that modulate the transition energy, such as microscopic dynamics, inter- and intramolecular couplings, and solvent dynamics. Because nonlinear response functions are sensitive to the complex dynamics of chemical processes, multidimensional vibrational spectroscopies can separate these processes. In multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy, the nonlinear response functions of a molecular dipole or polarizability are measured using ultrashort pulses to monitor inter- and intramolecular vibrational motions. Because a complex profile of such signals depends on the many dynamic and structural aspects of a molecular system, researchers would like to have a theoretical understanding of these phenomena. In this Account, we explore and describe the roles of different physical phenomena that arise from the peculiarities of the system-bath coupling in multidimensional spectra. We also present simple analytical expressions for a weakly coupled multimode Brownian system, which we use to analyze the results obtained by the experiments and simulations. To calculate the nonlinear optical response, researchers commonly use a particular form of a system Hamiltonian fit to the experimental results. The optical responses of molecular vibrational motions have been studied in either an oscillator model or a vibration energy state model. In principle, both models should give the same results as long as the energy states are chosen to be the eigenstates of the oscillator model. The energy state model can provide a simple description of nonlinear optical processes because the diagrammatic Liouville space theory that developed in the electronically resonant spectroscopies can easily handle three or four energy states involved in high-frequency vibrations. However, the energy state model breaks down if we include the thermal excitation and relaxation processes in the dynamics to put the system in a thermal equilibrium state. The roles of these excitation and relaxation processes are different and complicated compared with those in the resonant spectroscopy. Observing the effects of such thermal processes is more intuitive with the oscillator model because the bath modes, which cause the fluctuation and dissipation processes, are also described in the coordinate space. This coordinate space system-bath approach complements a realistic full molecular dynamics simulation approach. By comparing the calculated 2D spectra from the coordinate space model and the energy state model, we can examine the role of thermal processes and anharmonic mode-mode couplings in the energy state model. For this purpose, we employed the Brownian oscillator model with the nonlinear system-bath interaction. Using the hierarchy formalism, we could precisely calculate multidimensional spectra for a single and multimode anharmonic system for inter- and intramolecular vibrational modes.},

@article{Sakurai2011,
abstract = {To investigate the role of quantum effects in vibrational spectroscopies, we have carried out numerically exact calculations of linear and nonlinear response functions for an anharmonic potential system nonlinearly coupled to a harmonic oscillator bath. Although one cannot carry out the quantum calculations of the response functions with full molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for a realistic system which consists of many molecules, it is possible to grasp the essence of the quantum effects on the vibrational spectra by employing a model Hamiltonian that describes an intra- or intermolecular vibrational motion in a condensed phase. The present model fully includes vibrational relaxation, while the stochastic model often used to simulate infrared spectra does not. We have employed the reduced quantum hierarchy equations of motion approach in the Wigner space representation to deal with nonperturbative, non-Markovian, and nonsecular system - bath interactions. Taking the classical limit of the hierarchy equations of motion, we have obtained the classical equations of motion that describe the classical dynamics under the same physical conditions as in the quantum case. By comparing the classical and quantum mechanically calculated linear and multidimensional spectra, we found that the profiles of spectra for a fast modulation case were similar, but different for a slow modulation case. In both the classical and quantum cases, we identified the resonant oscillation peak in the spectra, but the quantum peak shifted to the red compared with the classical one if the potential is anharmonic. The prominent quantum effect is the 1 - 2 transition peak, which appears only in the quantum mechanically calculated spectra as a result of anharmonicity in the potential or nonlinearity of the system - bath coupling. While the contribution of the 1 - 2 transition is negligible in the fast modulation case, it becomes important in the slow modulation case as long as the amplitude of the frequency fluctuation is small. Thus, we observed a distinct difference between the classical and quantum mechanically calculated multidimensional spectra in the slow modulation case where spectral diffusion plays a role. This fact indicates that one may not reproduce the experimentally obtained multidimensional spectrum for high-frequency vibrational modes based on classical molecular dynamics simulations if the modulation that arises from surrounding molecules is weak and slow. A practical way to overcome the difference between the classical and quantum simulations was discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Craig2005b,
abstract = {We show how the ring-polymer molecular dynamics method can be adapted to calculate approximate Kubo-transformed flux-side correlation functions, and hence rate coefficients for condensed phase reactions. An application of the method to the standard model for a chemical reaction in solution--a quartic double-well potential linearly coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators--is found to give results of comparable accuracy to those of the classical Wigner model and the centroid molecular dynamics method. However, since the present method does not require that one evaluate the Wigner transform of a thermal flux operator or that one perform a separate path integral calculation for each molecular dynamics time step, we believe it will prove easier to apply to more general problems than either of these alternative techniques. We also present a (logarithmic) discretization scheme for the Ohmic bath in the system-bath model that gives converged results with just nine bath modes--a surprisingly small number for a model of a condensed phase reaction. Finally, we present some calculations of the transmission through an Eckart barrier which show that the present method provides a satisfactory (although not perfect) description of the deep quantum tunneling regime. Part of the reason for the success of the method is that it gives the exact quantum-mechanical rate constant for the transmission through a parabolic barrier, as we demonstrate analytically in the Appendix.},

Rather than being restricted to a small number of specific enzymes as perceived initially, it has now become an accepted mechanism for H?transfer in a growing number of enzymes. Furthermore, H?tunneling is driven by the thermally induced dynamics of the enzyme. In some of those enzymes that break stable C?H bonds the reaction proceeds purely by quantum tunneling, without the need to partially ascend the barrier. Enzymes studied that fall into this category include the flavoprotein and quinoprotein amine dehydrogenases, which have proved to be excellent model systems. These enzymes have enabled us to study the relationship between barrier shape and reaction kinetics. This has involved studies with ?slow? and ?fast? substrates and enzymes impaired by mutagenesis. A number of key questions now remain, including the nature of the coupling between protein dynamics and quantum tunneling. The wide?ranging implications of quantum tunneling introduce a paradigm shift in the conceptual framework for enzyme catalysis, inhibition and design.},

In quantum mechanics the probability of an event which can happen in several different ways is the absolute square of a sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative way. The probability that a particle will be found to have a path x(t) lying somewhere within a region of space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one from each path in the region. The contribution from a single path is postulated to be an exponential whose (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of ℏ) for the path in question. The total contribution from all paths reaching x, t from the past is the wave function $\psi$(x, t). This is shown to satisfy Schroedinger's equation. The relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed. Applications are indicated, in particular to eliminate the coordinates of the field oscillators from the equations of quantum electrodynamics.},

abstract = {Some coherence effects in chemical dynamics are described correctly by classical mechanics, while others only appear in a quantum treatment--and when these are observed experimentally it is not always immediately obvious whether their origin is classical or quantum. Semiclassical theory provides a systematic way of adding quantum coherence to classical molecular dynamics and thus provides a useful way to distinguish between classical and quantum coherence. Several examples are discussed which illustrate both cases. Particularly interesting is the situation with electronically non-adiabatic processes, where sometimes whether the coherence effects are classical or quantum depends on what specific aspects of the process are observed.},

Both methods predict very similar spectra in the low-frequency librational and intramolecular bending region at wavenumbers below 2500 cm(-1). However, the RPMD spectrum is contaminated in the high-frequency O-H stretching region by contributions from the internal vibrational modes of the ring polymer. This problem is avoided in the PA-CMD method, which adjusts the elements of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix so as to shift the frequencies of these vibrational modes beyond the spectral range of interest. PA-CMD does not require any more computational effort than RPMD and it is clearly the better of the two methods for simulating vibrational spectra.},

abstract = {Several methods to approximately evolve path integral centroid variables in real time are presented in this paper, the first of which, the centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) method, is recast into the new formalism of the preceding paper and thereby derived. The approximations involved in the CMD method are thus fully characterized by mathematical derivations. Additional new approaches are also presented: centroid Hamiltonian dynamics (CHD), linearized quantum dynamics (LQD), and a perturbative correction of the LQD method (PT-LQD). The CHD method is shown to be a variation of the CMD method which conserves the approximate time dependent centroid Hamiltonian. The LQD method amounts to a linear approximation for the quantum Liouville equation, while the PT-LQD method includes a perturbative correction to the LQD method. All of these approaches are then tested for the equilibrium position correlation functions of three different one-dimensional nondissipative model systems, and it is shown that certain quantum effects are accounted for by all of them, while others, such as the long time coherencecharacteristic of low-dimensional nondissipative systems, are not. The CMD method is found to be consistently better than the LQD method, while the PT-LQD method improves the latter and is better than the CMD method in most cases. The CHD method gives results complementary to those of the CMD method.},

Here we derive a mean-field version of this "Matsubara dynamics" which sufficiently mitigates its serious phase problem to permit numerical tests on a two-dimensional "champagne-bottle" model of a rotating OH bond. The Matsubara-dynamics rovibrational spectra are found to converge toward close agreement with the exact quantum results at all temperatures tested (200-800 K), the only significant discrepancies being a temperature-independent 22 cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} blue-shift in the position of the vibrational peak and a slight broadening in its line shape. These results are compared with centroid molecular dynamics (CMD) to assess the importance of non-centroid fluctuations. Above 250 K, only the lowest-frequency non-centroid modes are needed to correct small CMD red-shifts in the vibrational peak; below 250 K, more non-centroid modes are needed to correct large CMD red-shifts and broadening. The transition between these "shallow curvature" and "deep curvature" regimes happens when imaginary-time Feynman paths become able to lower their actions by cutting through the curved potential surface, giving rise to artificial instantons in CMD.},

@article{Caldeira1983a,
abstract = {In this paper we attempt to motivate, define, and resolve the question " What is the effect of dissipation on quantum tunnelling ? " The question is of particular interest in the context of tunnelling of a macroscopic variable such as the trapped flux in a SQUID, where we show that it is crucial to resolve it in the context of tests of the validity of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level, but it is also relevant to various microscopic tunnelling situations. We define the question as follows: Suppose we have a system, which has a metastable minimum and whose quasiclassical equation of motion in the region near the minimum is given by where the potential V(q) and friction coefficient q are regarded as experimentally determined quantities (and the energy dissipated irreversibly per unit time is simply {\~{}}4'). How does the tunnelling behaviour of such a system at T = 0 differ from that of one obeying a similar equation, with the same potential V(q) and mass M, but with friction coefficient rj equal to zero? We start by arguing that provided any one degree of freedom of the environment is only weakly perturbed by the motion of the system, then at T = 0 it is always possible, withour any toss of generality, to represent the environment as a bath of harmonic oscillators; moreover, if the damped equation of motion is indeed of the above form, then (barring, possibly, certain apparently pathological cases) it is possible to choose the system-bath coupling to be linear in the (suitably chosen) oscillator coordinates and a function only of the system coordinate (i.e., of the form Cj Fj(q) xj). In particular this is always possible for the important case of adiabatic DISSIPATION AND QUANTUM TUNNELLING 315 coupling. In certain cases (which we refer to ascases of " strictly linear " dissipation) it is possible further to restrict Fj(q) to be linear in q. In addition to this linear coupling, the interaction may also introduce an extra term (('counterterm ") in the effective potential V(q) felt by the system, which is just such as to cancel unphysical frequency shifts, etc., produced by the linear term. We discuss this point, which we believe to have caused some confusion in the recent literature, in some detail; in particular, we show that such a counterterm arises automatically both when the dissipative coupling is of the electromagnetic type realised, e.g., in a SQUID and when it is the correction to the zeroth-order adiabatic (Born-Oppenheimer) description. We next apply a variant of the " instanton " technique well known in particle physics to calculate the zero-temperature tunnelling rate out of the metastable minimum, By integrating out the environment variables explicitly, we can represent this rate in the form of a functional integral involving only the system variable q(r) but with the effective action containing an interaction term which is nonlocal in (imaginary) " time. " (Th e method is checked by applying it to the exactly soluble problem of a damped harmonic oscillator). As in the nondissipative case, the result for the tunnelling rate r can be written, in the WKB limit, in the form r = A exp -B/h, where B is the effective action evaluated along the " quasiclassical " path q(r) in the inverted potential, and A represents the effect of fluctuations around this path. The effect of dissipation is always to suppress the tunnelling, and in the strictly linear case the values of A and B are unique functions, for a given V(q), of the phenomenological dissipative coefficient v. In the more general case the corresponding function of q gives a lower limit on the tunnelling rate. We carry out a quantitative analysis of the general formula for the physically important case of strictly linear dissipation in a cubically anharmonic potential: in this case we show that the correction to the " undamped " exponent B, can be written LIB = @(a{\textgreater} as;, u = '1/2Mul,, where q is the phenomenological friction coefficient, w0 the frequency of small oscillations around the metastable minimum, and q,, the distance the (undamped) system would have to travel " under the barrier. " The dimensionless factor @(a) is always of order 1; we find its exact forms in the limit of weak and strong damping and put stringent limits on it for the intermediate case. We also obtain the form of the prefactor A in the strong-damping limit, where it is proportional to CX{\~{}}'{\~{}}{\~{}}+,, and give a prescription for calculating it more generally. We generalize our results to the case of nonlinear and frequency-dependent friction. We discuss the limits of validity of our results and some related problems concerning quantum coherence in a dissipative system, and outline possible future lines of development. 376 CALDEIRA ANDLEGGETT},

abstract = {The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a numerically exact approach for computing the reduced dynamics of a quantum system linearly coupled to a bath. We have found that HEOM contains temperature-dependent instabilities that grow exponentially in time. In the case of continuous-bath models, these instabilities may be delayed to later times by increasing the hierarchy dimension; however, for systems coupled to discrete, non-dispersive modes, increasing the hierarchy dimension does little to alleviate the problem. We show that these instabilities can also be removed completely at a potentially much lower cost via projection onto the space of stable eigenmodes; furthermore, we find that for discrete-bath models at zero temperature, the remaining projected dynamics computed with few hierarchy levels are essentially identical to the exact dynamics that otherwise might require an intractably large number of hierarchy levels for convergence. Recognizing that computation of the eigenmodes might be prohibitive, e.g. for large or strongly-coupled models, we present a Prony filtration algorithm that may be useful as an alternative for accomplishing this projection when diagonalization is too costly. We present results demonstrating the efficacy of HEOM projected via diagonalization and Prony filtration. We also discuss issues associated with the nonnormality of HEOM.},

abstract = {The ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and partially adiabatic centroid molecular dynamics (PA-CMD) methods are compared and contrasted in an application to the infrared absorption spectrum of a recently parametrized flexible, polarizable, Thole-type potential energy model for liquid water. Both methods predict very similar spectra in the low-frequency librational and intramolecular bending region at wavenumbers below 2500 cm(-1). However, the RPMD spectrum is contaminated in the high-frequency O-H stretching region by contributions from the internal vibrational modes of the ring polymer. This problem is avoided in the PA-CMD method, which adjusts the elements of the Parrinello-Rahman mass matrix so as to shift the frequencies of these vibrational modes beyond the spectral range of interest. PA-CMD does not require any more computational effort than RPMD and it is clearly the better of the two methods for simulating vibrational spectra.},

abstract = {A general relationship is established between semiclassical and centroid-based methods for calculating real-time quantum-mechanical correlation functions. It is first shown that the linearized semiclassical initial-value-representation (LSC-IVR) approximation can be obtained via direct linearization of the forward-backward action in the exact path integral expression for the correlation function. A Kubo-transformed two-time correlation function, with the position operator as one of the two operators, is then cast in terms of a carefully crafted exact path integral expression. Linearization of the corresponding forward–backward action, supplemented by the assumption that the dynamics of the centroid is decoupled from that of the higher normal modes, is then shown to lead to the centroid correlation function.{\textcopyright} 2003 American Institute of Physics. {\textcopyright} 2003 American Institute of Physics},

abstract = {We investigate the calculation of approximate non-equilibrium quantum time correlation functions (TCFs) using two popular path-integral-based molecular dynamics methods, ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) and centroid molecular dynamics (CMD). It is shown that for the cases of a sudden vertical excitation and an initial momentum impulse, both RPMD and CMD yield non-equilibrium TCFs for linear operators that are exact for high temperatures, in the t = 0 limit, and for harmonic potentials; the subset of these conditions that are preserved for non-equilibrium TCFs of non-linear operators is also discussed. Furthermore, it is shown that for these non-equilibrium initial conditions, both methods retain the connection to Matsubara dynamics that has previously been established for equilibrium initial conditions. Comparison of non-equilibrium TCFs from RPMD and CMD to Matsubara dynamics at short times reveals the orders in time to which the methods agree.

abstract = {We develop two classes of quasi-classical dynamics that are shown to conserve the initial quantum ensemble when used in combination with the Feynman-Kleinert approximation of the density operator. These dynamics are used to improve the Feynman-Kleinert implementation of the classical Wigner approximation for the evaluation of quantum time correlation functions known as Feynman-Kleinert linearized path-integral. As shown, both classes of dynamics are able to recover the exact classical and high temperature limits of the quantum time correlation function, while a subset is able to recover the exact harmonic limit. A comparison of the approximate quantum time correlation functions obtained from both classes of dynamics is made with the exact results for the challenging model problems of the quartic and double-well potentials. It is found that these dynamics provide a great improvement over the classical Wigner approximation, in which purely classical dynamics are used. In a special case, our first method becomes identical to centroid molecular dynamics.},

Both methods can be used to compute quasiclassical time correlation functions which have direct application in molecular spectroscopy; in particular, to infrared spectroscopy via dipole autocorrelation functions. The performance of both methods for computing vibrational spectra of several simple but representative molecular model systems is investigated systematically as a function of temperature and isotopic substitution. In this context both CMD and RPMD feature intrinsic problems which are quantified and investigated in detail. Based on the obtained results guidelines for using CMD and RPMD to compute infrared spectra of molecular systems are provided.},

@article{Colbert1992,
abstract = {A novel discrete variable representation (DVR) is introduced for use as the L 2 basis of the S‐matrix version of the Kohn variational method [Zhang, Chu, and Miller, J. Chem. Phys. 8 8, 6233 (1988)] for quantum reactive scattering. (It can also be readily used for quantum eigenvalue problems.) The primary novel feature is that this DVR gives an extremely simple kinetic energy matrix (the potential energy matrix is diagonal, as in all DVRs) which is in a sense ‘‘universal,'' i.e., independent of any explicit reference to an underlying set of basis functions; it can, in fact, be derived as an infinite limit using different basis functions. An energy truncation procedure allows the DVR grid points to be adapted naturally to the shape of any given potential energy surface. Application to the benchmark collinear H+H2→H2+H reaction shows that convergence in the reaction probabilities is achieved with only about 15{\%} more DVR grid points than the number of conventional basis functions used in previous S‐matrix Kohn calculations. Test calculations for the collinear Cl+HCl→ClH+Cl reaction shows that the unusual dynamical features of heavy+light‐heavy reactions are also well described by this approach. Since DVR approaches avoid having to evaluate integrals in order to obtain the Hamiltonian matrix and since a DVR Hamiltonian matrix is extremely sparse, this DVR version of the S‐matrix Kohn approach should make it possible to deal with more complex chemical reactions than heretofore possible.},
