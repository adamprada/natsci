# natsci-latex

This is a LaTeX (i.e. pdfLaTeX or LaTeX, but not XeLaTeX) version of the natsci
package. It should have the similar functionality as the natsci package, including
the macros, with following changes:

-   Upright small Greek letters are provided by the package upgreek.
-   Package bm is used for consistent boldening of symbols
-   babel is used instead of polyglossia
